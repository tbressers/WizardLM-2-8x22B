## News üî•üî•üî• [2024/04/15]

We introduce and opensource WizardLM-2, our next generation state-of-the-art large language models, 
which have improved performance on complex chat, multilingual, reasoning and agent. 
New family includes three cutting-edge models: WizardLM-2 8x22B, WizardLM-2 70B, and WizardLM-2 7B.

- WizardLM-2 8x22B is our most advanced model, demonstrates highly competitive performance compared to those leading proprietary works 
and consistently outperforms all the existing state-of-the-art opensource models.
- WizardLM-2 70B reaches top-tier reasoning capabilities and is the first choice in the same size. 
- WizardLM-2 7B is the fastest and achieves comparable performance with existing 10x larger opensource leading models.

For more  details of WizardLM-2 please read our [release blog post](https://wizardlm.github.io/WizardLM2) and  upcoming paper.

## Model Capacities


**MT-Bench**

We also adopt the automatic MT-Bench evaluation framework based on GPT-4 proposed by lmsys to assess the performance of models. 
The WizardLM-2 8x22B even demonstrates highly competitive performance compared to the most advanced proprietary models. 
Meanwhile, WizardLM-2 7B and WizardLM-2 70B are all the top-performing models among the other leading baselines at 7B to 70B model scales.

</p>


**Human Preferences Evaluation**

We carefully collected a complex and challenging set consisting of real-world instructions, which includes main requirements of humanity, such as writing, coding, math, reasoning, agent, and multilingual. 
We report the win:loss rate without tie:

- WizardLM-2 8x22B is just slightly falling behind GPT-4-1106-preview, and significantly stronger than Command R Plus and GPT4-0314.
- WizardLM-2 70B is better than GPT4-0613, Mistral-Large, and Qwen1.5-72B-Chat.
- WizardLM-2 7B is comparable with Qwen1.5-32B-Chat, and surpasses Qwen1.5-14B-Chat and Starling-LM-7B-beta.

## Usage

‚ùó<b>Note for model system prompts usage:</b>


<b>WizardLM-2</b>  adopts the prompt format from <b>Vicuna</b> and supports **multi-turn** conversation. The prompt should be as following:

```
A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, 
detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Hi ASSISTANT: Hello.</s>
USER: Who are you? ASSISTANT: I am WizardLM.</s>......
```

<b> Inference WizardLM-2 Demo Script</b>

We provide a WizardLM-2 inference demo [code](https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM/tree/main/demo) on our github.
